```java

    /**
     * Creates a <code>FileInputStream</code> by
     * opening a connection to an actual file,
     * the file named by the <code>File</code>
     * object <code>file</code> in the file system.
     * A new <code>FileDescriptor</code> object
     * is created to represent this file connection.
     * <p>
     * First, if there is a security manager,
     * its <code>checkRead</code> method  is called
     * with the path represented by the <code>file</code>
     * argument as its argument.
     * <p>
     * If the named file does not exist, is a directory rather than a regular
     * file, or for some other reason cannot be opened for reading then a
     * <code>FileNotFoundException</code> is thrown.
     *
     * @param      file   the file to be opened for reading.
     * @exception  FileNotFoundException  if the file does not exist,
     *                   is a directory rather than a regular file,
     *                   or for some other reason cannot be opened for
     *                   reading.
     * @exception  SecurityException      if a security manager exists and its
     *               <code>checkRead</code> method denies read access to the file.
     * @see        java.io.File#getPath()
     * @see        java.lang.SecurityManager#checkRead(java.lang.String)
